# Execution Log

## Implemented Features
- [Repo scaffolding] Initialized pnpm TypeScript monorepo with core package and tests. Status: Done.
- [F1.2 Minimal Core] Implemented minimal TicketManager (create/list) with gray-matter and unit tests. Status: Done.

## Code Changes & Decisions
- Added pnpm workspace (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`) and root `package.json` with workspaces.
- Created base TS config (`tsconfig.base.json`) and package `@min-pmt/core` with minimal functions.
- Wired Vitest for testing; added sample unit tests.
- Updated `.gitignore` to include macOS, IDE, and pnpm logs.
- See Design: frontmatter-first status remains guiding principle for future implementation.
 - Implemented `TicketManager` with frontmatter-as-source-of-truth (create, list). Exported types and manager via core index.
 - Added tests covering create and list with filters.

## Integration Notes
- Use pnpm v10+ (declared via packageManager) and Node 18+.
- Packages reside under `packages/*`; add new packages there.

## Technical Debt
- CLI, Core Ticket Engine, MCP server, and WebUI not yet implemented—scaffold only.
- Decide linter/formatter (ESLint/Prettier) and CI.

## Suggested Tests
[Execution → QA] Validate TicketManager create/list across edge cases and malformed frontmatter scenarios.
- Unit tests for core ticket parsing, listing, and status updates once implemented.
- Integration tests for CLI commands (init, add, list, move) using temp dirs.
 - Edge cases: malformed frontmatter, missing fields, large directories, concurrent writes.
